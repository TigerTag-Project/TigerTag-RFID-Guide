# SpoolmanDB Materials from TigerTag API Rest

This folder contains a pre-generated `materials.json` file that is compatible with **Spoolman**, a popular filament database and spool tracking system for 3D printing.

## 📦 What is this?

We've generated this JSON file to help Spoolman users quickly import a curated list of 3D printing materials from the TigerTag project. This dataset includes standardized material definitions based on our open-source RFID protocol for 3D printing spools.

## 🌐 TigerTag REST API (Free and Open)

You can also access the live and always up-to-date version of the materials list directly from our public REST API:

- 🔄 Live JSON endpoint: [https://api.tigertag.io/api:tigertag/SpoolmanDB/materials](https://api.tigertag.io/api:tigertag/SpoolmanDB/materials)
- 📘 API Documentation (Swagger): [https://api.tigertag.io/api:tigertag](https://api.tigertag.io/api:tigertag)

The TigerTag API is:
- ✅ Free to use
- ✅ Unlimited access
- ✅ Anonymous (no login required)
- ✅ Agnostic (usable with any system, app, or backend)

## 🔗 How to use it in Spoolman
